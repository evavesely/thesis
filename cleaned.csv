'' you smuggle it with a shipment of dope . like heroin . the microdots are so small no one would notice . barris had this other idea for smuggling dope . you know how the custom guys , they ask you to declare what you have ? well , you take a huge block of hash and you carve it in the shape of a man . then you hollow out a little section and put a wind-up motor in . and a cassette tape . and just before it goes through customs , you wind it up and it walks up to the man , who says , `` do you have anything to declare ? '' and it says , `` no , i do n't , '' and keeps on walking . what 's the use of that ? a billion dollars ? they 'd wonder what it meant by that . can you imagine telling your grandkids , `` i saw with my own eyes a six foot block of hash appear and walk past , worth two billion dollars , saying , `` no , i do n't . '' his grandchildren would have him committed . the kids would n't believe that either . ... this guy appeared on tv , claiming to be a world-famous imposter . he said he 'd posed at one time or another as a great surgeon , a theoretical submolecular high-velocity particle research physicist , a finnish novelist , a deposed president of argentina ... see , the guy never really posed as any of it . he only posed as a world- famous imposter . turns out he just pushed a broom at disneyland , until he read about this actual world-famous imposter , and he thought , i can pose as all those things , then he thought , hell , i 'll just pose as an imposter . save a lot of time , a lot easier . made almost as much money as the real imposter with books and movie rights . narks , you mean . yeah , i wonder what a nark looks like ? narks give me the creeps .

14936,pulp fiction,YOUNG MAN,m,"no , forget it , it 's too risky . i 'm through doin ' that shit . i know that 's what i always say . i 'm always right too , but   yeah , well , the days of me forgittin ' are over , and the days of me rememberin ' have just begun . i sound like a sensible fucking man , is what i sound like . well take heart , 'cause you 're never gon na hafta hear it again . because since i 'm never gon na do it again , you 're never gon na hafta hear me quack about how i 'm never gon na do it again . correct . i got all tonight to quack . i 'm doin ' fine . i mean the way it is now , you 're takin ' the same fuckin ' risk as when you rob a bank . you take more of a risk . banks are easier ! federal banks are n't supposed to stop you anyway , during a robbery . they 're insured , why should they care ? you do n't even need a gun in a federal bank . i heard about this guy , walked into a federal bank with a portable phone , handed the phone to the teller , the guy on the other end of the phone said : `` we got this guy 's little girl , and if you do n't give him all your money , we 're gon na kill 'er . '' fuckin ' a it worked , that 's what i 'm talkin ' about ! knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone , not a pistol , not a shotgun , but a fuckin ' phone , cleans the place out , and they do n't lift a fuckin ' finger . i do n't know . there probably never was a little girl  the point of the story is n't the little girl . the point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone . i 'm not sayin ' i wan na rob banks , i 'm just illustrating that if we did , it would be easier than what we been doin ' . naw , all those guys are goin ' down the same road , either dead or servin ' twenty . what have we been talking about ? yeah , no more-liquor-stores . besides , it ai n't the giggle it usta be . too many foreigners own liquor stores . vietnamese , koreans , they ca n't fuckin ' speak english . you tell 'em : `` empty out the register , '' and they do n't know what it fuckin ' means . they make it too personal . we keep on , one of those gook motherfuckers ' gon na make us kill 'em . i do n't wan na kill anybody either . but they 'll probably put us in a situation where it 's us of them . and if it 's not the gooks , it these old jews who 've owned the store for fifteen fuckin ' generations . ya got grandpa irving sittin ' behind the counter with a fuckin ' magnum . try walkin ' into one of those stores with nothin ' but a telephone , see how far it gets you . fuck it , forget it , we 're out of it . not this life . garcon ! coffee ! this place . what 's wrong with that ? people never rob restaurants , why not ? bars , liquor stores , gas stations , you get your head blown off stickin ' up one of them . restaurants , on the other hand , you catch with their pants down . they 're not expecting to get robbed , or not as expecting . correct . just like banks , these places are insured . the managers do n't give a fuck , they 're just tryin ' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin ' diners . waitresses , forget it , they ai n't takin ' a bullet for the register . busboys , some wetback gettin ' paid a dollar fifty a hour gon na really give a fuck you 're stealin ' from the owner . customers are sittin ' there with food in their mouths , they do n't know what 's goin ' on . one minute they 're havin ' a denver omelet , next minute somebody 's stickin ' a gun in their face . see , i got the idea last liquor store we stuck up . 'member all those customers kept comin ' in ? then you got the idea to take everybody 's wallet . that was a good idea . we made more from the wallets then we did the register . a lot of people go to restaurants . pretty smart , huh ? remember , same as before , you 're crowd control , i handle the employees . i love you , .
